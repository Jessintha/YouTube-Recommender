# YouTube-Video-Recommender
Given the plethora of data science online resources available, choosing the right content can be a daunting task for learners. With highly skilled professionals creating and publishing quality content on YouTube, the platform has been my go-to to pick up relevant skills. In this project I try to help ease the decision-making process for learners by building a video recommendation system with data retrieved from the YouTube API.

- First I extracted data using the YouTube API (ref: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)
- In the coming days, I plan to automate the extraction process for a dynamic database
- Shall further explore various methods to create recommendations based on user input.
